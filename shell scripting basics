Shell: Shell is a way to talk to operating system.It is a command line interface.For example 'bash' is a most common shell.
Shell scripting: It is essentially a text file containing a series of commands that you would normally type into the command line manually.The shell reads these commands and executes them.

Why shell script?
To automate repetitive tasks we need shell script.
For example you are a devops  engineer in Amazon and you need to check 10,000 VMs for Node Health, CPU utilization, memory usage. So for this task you can write a shell script.

Role of shell script in devops:
-Infrastructure management
-Code repository management
-Configuration management
